                    <p>Hi I'm Damian!</p>
                    <p>I joined the Isleham United Athena's coaching team shortly after my daughter started training.</p>
                    <p>I have since become the head coach of the U8's team after they were entered into the league.</p>
                    <p>I knew from day one that the girls love playing matches and with each game I have seen them improve massively.</p>
                    <p>Seeing how much the coaches care and dedicate so much made me want to join and I am equally committed to helping 
                        the girls improve and enjoy every match and training session!</p>
